# 🏆 Official Lean AI Native Companies Leaderboard

The official leaderboard tracking the rise of lean AI native companies that are revolutionizing the startup world. This project monitors companies generating significant revenue with minimal teams, pioneering the path toward the "1-person billion dollar company" vision.

## About

This leaderboard tracks AI Native companies that demonstrate the potential of artificial intelligence to enable small teams to achieve outsized results. The project was created by [Henry Shi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrythe9th/), a repeat founder who previously built a $150MM+ annual revenue startup.

The initiative is inspired by Sam Altman's vision:
> "We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it... There'll soon be a 1-person billion dollar company"
